LANGUAGE_RULES = """Language rules:
- Write for a smart nontechnical hiring manager or client.
- Use simple, clear, concise, direct language.
- Avoid jargon, buzzwords, and abstract phrases.
- Prefer business or product outcomes over technical explanation.
- If a technical term from the job post is necessary, use it once and connect it to the client's outcome.
- Replace vague phrases like "scalable architecture", "robust solution", "end-to-end", "production-ready", and "leveraging technology" with concrete plain-English descriptions of what was built or improved.
- Keep sentences short. Prefer one clear idea per sentence.
- Before returning, revise the draft once to remove jargon and make it sound like a capable person explaining their fit plainly."""

- Add useful context beyond a resume: working style, similar domain fit, availability, contract setup, or ability to adapt to new tools and domains.

Information rules:
- Use only the information below. Do not invent experience, metrics, tools, client names, timelines, or outcomes.
- Treat `resume.text` as the only resume content. If `resume.warnings` says the resume is missing or unreadable, do not fill resume details from memory or assumptions.

Return JSON matching the provided schema.

Writing rules:
- Set `draft_type` to `{request.draft_type}`.
- Put the generated application body in `draft_text`.
- Classify the role in `role_classification` in plain terms, such as "frontend staff augmentation", "founder MVP build", or "AI workflow automation".
- Choose the strongest angle for this job. You may reuse an available offer, narrow it, or create a custom angle when the offers do not fit.
- Choose 0-3 project slugs from `available_projects`; prefer 1-2. Use no project if none is genuinely relevant.

{LANGUAGE_RULES}

{draft_rules}

{experience_rules}

Audit fields only:
- Set `selected_angle.key` to an available offer key when reusing one; otherwise set a short custom key such as "frontend_staff_augmentation".
- Include rejected projects when they seem plausible from surface wording but are strategically weak.
- Every application claim must appear in `claims[]` with where it came from in `caused_by`.
- Every meaningful drafting or strategy decision must appear in `decisions[]` with where it came from in `caused_by`.
- Add warnings for weak experience matches, noisy extraction, missing job details, missing exact tool or industry matches, or a role that should not use a project example.
- When exact tool or industry experience is weak but the profile or projects show relevant adaptation across tools, domains, or product constraints, include one honest adaptability claim with where it came from.
- Use these labels in `caused_by`: `profile`, `resume.text`, opportunity fields like `opportunity.description`, offer `source_ref` values, and project labels from each project's `source_refs`, `project.<slug>.claim`, and `project.<slug>.technologies`.
- Keep audit and source-tracking language in these JSON audit fields, not in the applicant-facing draft.
